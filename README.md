# LAMBDA API GATEWAY
> Let’s use Lambda to expose our repeated-word-in-sentence functionality to the world!

## Summary
> A user should be able to find the first repeated word in a sentence by visiting a URL.
  That URL should use API Gateway to call a Lambda function that finds the first repeated word in a sentence.
  You should use a query string parameter to pass in the sentence data.
  
## How Do I Use This?
> To be added.

## Issues
1. I was not able to complete the features.

## Changelog
1. Lab 33: Lambda with API Gateway
    1. To Do
        -[ ] Migrate code from your DS&A repo into this new repo for today that will find the first repeated word in a sentence.
        -[ ] Test that migrated code to ensure that it works as a method.
        -[ ] Create a .jar file and upload that code to AWS Lambda. Use the console’s Test button to make sure you can find the first repeated word in a sentence.
                Your test configuration should look like just a string, i.e. "This is the sentence with the words" should return the.
        -[ ] Create an API with API Gateway and connect it to this Lambda function.
